# Revived 

[http://www.revived.ca](http://www.revived.ca/)

This is the code for my first website created with Sami Zubair back in 2012. The code is unbelievable garbage but 
hey, we had no idea what we were doing, and it kinda turned out okay? And we fixed phones for 2 years for cash 
during university!

## Highlights of Garbage
- First up, apparently I didn't know how to PHP (or the concept of a boolean?): [index.php](/index.php#L11)
It's also worth noting there that there's an `index.html` and `index.php` because how else to get a form-submission to
not end in a blank page?
- Directories were too much to handle with urls for me.
- Next up, [this gem](/estimatesScript.js#L1-L107) Where I had written some java code elsewhere to read an excel 
inventory file and generate the top definitions (because `.csv` export and loading in js was wayyy beyond me)
- I'll also point to [the footer](/footer.js) which was the best way I could get code-reuse for the pages :stuck_out_tongue:
- CSS was all done basically pixel by pixel with no understanding of how layout works...
